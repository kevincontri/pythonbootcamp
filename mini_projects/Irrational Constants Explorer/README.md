## Irrational Constants Explorer

### Overview
This mini-project consists in a Python script that generates famous irrational constants (π, e, φ, γ, Catalan, Apéry) to N decimal places using the mpmath library.  
Optionally saves results to a `.txt` file with a timestamp.

### Features
- Choose from multiple constants
- Specify precision (0–1000 decimal places)
- Save results to a file for later use

### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python irrational_constants.py
2. Select a constant (e.g., pi, e, phi).

3. Enter the number of decimal places.

4. View the result in the console or save it to a file.

**OBS**: `mpmath` library installation is required! 
```bash
pip install mpmath
