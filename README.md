- Projects and exercises from the course **"The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python"** on Udemy
- This repository is my learning journey, where i practice Python concepts through hands-on projects.

**Milestone projects along the course**:
- <code>tictactoe.py</code> - A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python where you can play directly in the terminal.
- <code>war.py</code> - A Python implementation of the War card game, showcasing the game’s mechanics through a bot-vs-bot simulation.
- <code>blackjack.py</code> - A simplified version of the classic Blackjack card game, where the player competes against the dealer (computer) using a single deck of 52 cards.

**`mini-projects`** folder:
- This folder contains a collection of small Python projects that I’ve built to practice and improve my programming skills.
- There's a `README.md` inside the folder explaining each project and how to test it.

**How to run**:
- Once you clone the repo, run the project with: <code>python project_name.py</code>
