- Projects and exercises from the course **"The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python"** on Udemy

- <code>tictactoe.py</code> - A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python where you can play directly in the terminal.
- <code>war.py</code> - A Python implementation of the War card game, showcasing the game’s mechanics through a bot-vs-bot simulation.
- <code>blackjack.py</code> - A simplified version of the classic Blackjack card game, where the player competes against the dealer (computer) using a single deck of 52 cards.
